## Map layers
There are 4 total map layers
1. will be the most back layer(Think of your ocean tiles, your grass etc)
2. This will be where most of the tiles will be put, trees, buildings, etc
3. This operates similar to rom hack's triple layer, letting you add extra flourishes
4. This acts as the event layer that renders layer 1 - 3

## Maps prefixes
Map prefixed with the title of SUMMER, FALL, SPRING, WINTER will correspond to the map when the seasons are triggered. This allows variety in maps/events.
